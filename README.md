# Core

The goal of this open source project is to make application development—especially in business environments—easier, faster, and more straightforward. The ultimate objective is that anyone with limited coding knowledge can create their own application in JavaScript with minimal effort. Additionally, the GUI should be auto-generated.

## Development Status

> ⚠️ **In Development – Not Ready for Production**

This project is currently under active development. Please note the following:

- **Tenancy feature not working**  
  The tenancy feature exists only as a placeholder and has no effect.

- **API not finished**  
  Many functions are not yet implemented and will be added in future releases.

- **Insufficient test coverage**  
  More tests are planned; at the moment, only the most critical areas are covered.

- **Incomplete documentation**  
  No documentation is available at the moment; it will be provided later.

- **Some important security features are missing**  
  Features such as OIDC and a Key Vault are currently absent but will be implemented in the future.

- **Missing UI**  
  No GUI has been implemented yet. The goal is to have an admin GUI and a dynamically generated GUI for the applications built with this library.
